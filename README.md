Lyra Sample Game
===

Content Information
----
To run this sample you will need the following version of Unreal Engine from the Epic Games Launcher:
	- Unreal Engine 5.4.4

When downloading the Lyra Sample from BULKHEAD's git, in order to reduce git space the content folders are not included.

Therefore, you will need to download the Lyra Game Sample Content from the Unreal Marketplace through the Epic Games Launcher.

Follow the following steps to do this:
	1. Ensure you have 5.4.4 from the Epic Games Launcher
	2. Follow the guide at [Unreal Engine Lyra documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.4) to download the Lyra Sample.
	3. Create a Lyra Sample Game Project for UE 5.4.4.
	4. Once you have created a Lyra Sample Game Project, copy the Content folder from the sample into the BULKHEAD version from git.
	5. Open the code solution in your IDE of choice.
		- (Preferred) For Rider, Open the .uproject directly.
		- For Visual Studio, right click the .uproject and select "Generate Visual Studio project files".
	5. Build & Run.
	6. The Editor should open and you should be good to go!
